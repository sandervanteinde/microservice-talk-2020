# microservice-talk-2020
Microservice talk given at Fontys Tilburg
This repositories contains the labs associated with the talk.

## Starting the labs

In the [Labs](/labs) folder you can find all the labs.
You should start with one of the two preperation labs.

One is aimed for users that would like to use Docker. The other is aimed for users who are not able to run Docker, or simply don't use Docker.

I recommend using the Docker approach because this will get you started fairly quickly.


## Labs

1. Starter
  - [Starter docker](Labs/Lab-1-preperation.md)
  - [Starter not-docker](Labs/Lab-1-preperation-without-docker.md)
2. [PlayerService](Labs/Lab-2-playerservice.md)
3. [QuestService](Labs/Lab-3-playerservice.md)
4. [Completing the solution](Labs/Lab-4-completing-the-solution.md)
